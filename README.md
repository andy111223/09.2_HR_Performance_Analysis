# HR Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of HR performance data to uncover insights into employee satisfaction, tenure, and project involvement. The analysis aims to demonstrate the author's proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization using Python's powerful libraries.

## Analysis Objectives

1. **Manager Influence:** Investigate the relationship between managers and employee performance scores.
2. **Recruitment Efficiency:** Determine which recruitment sources yield the longest employee tenure.
3. **Marital Status Impact:** Explore how marital status correlates with employee satisfaction.
4. **Age Structure:** Analyze the age distribution of currently employed staff.
5. **Project Involvement:** Assess whether older employees engage in more special projects than their younger counterparts.

## Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3+**
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn:** Advanced data visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** Basic plotting library.
- **Statsmodels & Scipy:** Statistical analysis.

## Data Visualization

The analysis employs a variety of Seaborn plots to visualize data effectively:

- **Histograms with KDE:** To display age distributions and performance scores.
- **Box Plots:** To compare distributions of satisfaction scores and special project counts across different categories.
- **Violin Plots:** To illustrate the distribution and density of continuous variables like age and satisfaction.
- **Scatter Plots:** To examine correlations between numerical variables such as age and number of special projects.
- **Bar Plots:** To visualize average values across categorical groups like recruitment sources and marital status.
- **Heatmaps:** For correlation matrices to identify relationships between multiple variables.
- **Count Plots:** To show the frequency of categorical variables like marital status and recruitment sources.

## Repository Structure

- **`main.ipynb`**: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical tests, and visualizations.
- **`HRDataset.csv`**: The dataset

## Purpose

The author has undertaken this analysis to **demonstrate expertise in data science**, particularly in handling and interpreting complex HR datasets. By leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualization, the analysis provides actionable insights that can inform HR strategies and decision-making processes.
